# Student-Performance-Prediction
Objective : To predict students' final exam score (G3) based on study time, past grades, failures, and absences using machine learning models.
Models Used : Linear Regression , Random Forest Regressor
Evaluation Metrics : R² Score , Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Tools : Python , Scikit-learn , Pandas , Seaborn / Matplotlib
Findings : Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression (higher R² and lower MSE) , Visualization showed strong correlation between G2 and G3.
